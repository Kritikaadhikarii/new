    <p>I've always been a book lover. I was always someone who would rush to buy newly released books. But, I found out that the book market of Nepal isn't so good and it isnt updated frequently. Hence, I had to wait for a really long time to get a newly released book which somewhat decreased my interests in buying new books. But after my grade 12, my interest for reading new books came back, but the problem with the market was still the same. Hence, I decided to create a online based book shop, which would provide newly released books very quickly and at a very low profit margin. The profit margin is almost 5 to 10 rupees per books.</p>
